This means the codes used in route or form may pre-coordinate the method in the route code or the form code.  The implementation decision about what coding system to use for route or form code will determine how frequently the method code will be populated e.g. if route or form code pre-coordinate method code, then this attribute will not be populated often; if there is no pre-coordination then method code may  be used frequently.","min":0,"max":"1","base":{"path":"MedicationAdministration.dosage.method","min":0,"max":"1"},"type":[{"code":"CodeableConcept"}],"isModifier":false,"isSummary":false,"binding":{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-bindingName","valueString":"MedicationAdministrationMethod"}],"strength":"example","description":"A coded concept describing the technique by which the medicine is administered.","valueSet":"http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/administration-method-codes"},"mapping":[{"identity":"v2","map":"RXR-4-Administration Method"},{"identity":"rim","map":".methodCode"}]}]}}
