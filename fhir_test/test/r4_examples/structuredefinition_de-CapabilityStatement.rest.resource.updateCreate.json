Obviously, if there is only one client, this won't happen. While creating identities on the client means that the clients need to be managed, it's much more convenient for many scenarios if such management can be put in place.","min":0,"max":"1","base":{"path":"CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.updateCreate","min":0,"max":"1"},"type":[{"code":"boolean"}],"isModifier":false,"isSummary":false}]}}
