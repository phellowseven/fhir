Other examples include endoscopy for dilatation and biopsy (a combination of diagnostic and therapeutic use). \nUse Procedure.reasonCode when a code sufficiently describes the reason.  Use Procedure.reasonReference when referencing a resource, which allows more information to be conveyed, such as onset date. Procedure.reasonCode and Procedure.reasonReference are not meant to be duplicative.  For a single reason, either Procedure.reasonCode or Procedure.reasonReference can be used.  Procedure.reasonCode may be a summary code, or Procedure.reasonReference may be used to reference a very precise definition of the reason using Condition | Observation | Procedure | DiagnosticReport | DocumentReference.  Both Procedure.reasonCode and Procedure.reasonReference can be used if they are describing different reasons for the procedure.","min":0,"max":"*","base":{"path":"Procedure.reasonReference","min":0,"max":"*"},"type":[{"code":"Reference","targetProfile":["http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Condition","http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Observation","http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Procedure","http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/DiagnosticReport","http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/DocumentReference"]}],"isModifier":false,"isSummary":true,"mapping":[{"identity":"workflow","map":"Event.reasonReference"},{"identity":"w5","map":"FiveWs.why[x]"},{"identity":"rim","map":".reasonCode"}]}]}}
