Abstract datatypes and extensions cannot be used in an instance. For logical models, the exact implication of \"abstract\" will rest with the author, depending how the logical model is used. Flagging a constraint structure as abstract conveys design intent but makes no difference to how the structure definition is handled. Note that inline declared elements that are given the type \"Element\" in the StructureDefinition, but have children described, are anonymous concrete types that specialize Element.","min":1,"max":"1","base":{"path":"StructureDefinition.abstract","min":1,"max":"1"},"type":[{"code":"boolean"}],"isModifier":false,"isSummary":true}]}}
