When immunizations are patient reported, a specific date might not be known.  Although partial dates are allowed, an adult patient might not be able to recall the year a childhood immunization was given. An exact date is always preferable, but the use of the String data type is acceptable when an exact date is not known. A small number of vaccines (e.g. live oral typhoid vaccine) are given as a series of patient self-administered dose over a span of time. In cases like this, often, only the first dose (typically a provider supervised dose) is recorded with the occurrence indicating the date/time of the first dose.","min":1,"max":"1","base":{"path":"Immunization.occurrence[x]","min":1,"max":"1"},"type":[{"code":"dateTime"},{"code":"string"}],"isModifier":false,"isSummary":true,"mapping":[{"identity":"workflow","map":"Event.occurrence[x]"},{"identity":"w5","map":"FiveWs.done[x]"},{"identity":"v2","map":"RXA-3"},{"identity":"rim","map":".effectiveTime"},{"identity":"cda","map":"ClinicalDocument/component/StructuredBody/component/section/entry/substanceAdministration/effectiveTime/value"}]}]}}
