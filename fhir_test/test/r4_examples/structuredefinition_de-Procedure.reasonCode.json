Use Procedure.reasonReference when referencing a resource, which allows more information to be conveyed, such as onset date.

Procedure.reasonCode may be a summary code, or Procedure.reasonReference may be used to reference a very precise definition of the reason using Condition | Observation | Procedure | DiagnosticReport | DocumentReference.  Both Procedure.reasonCode and Procedure.reasonReference can be used if they are describing different reasons for the procedure.","min":0,"max":"*","base":{"path":"Procedure.reasonCode","min":0,"max":"*"},"type":[{"code":"CodeableConcept"}],"isModifier":false,"isSummary":true,"binding":{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-bindingName","valueString":"ProcedureReason"}],"strength":"example","description":"A code that identifies the reason a procedure is  required.","valueSet":"http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/procedure-reason"},"mapping":[{"identity":"workflow","map":"Event.reasonCode"},{"identity":"w5","map":"FiveWs.why[x]"},{"identity":"rim","map":".reasonCode"}]}]}}
