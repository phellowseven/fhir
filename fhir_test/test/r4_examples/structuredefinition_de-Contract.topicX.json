This element supports narrowing the area of concern to more specific term topics within this Contract. Given the wide range of contract topics, implementers need to be cognizant of the business use case for which they are designing a FHIR Contract, and narrowly specify the topic being represented with respect to the Contract.type and any specializing Contract.subtype. The same topic, e.g., an asset such as a good or service, such as a real property, medical supply, insurance, information, a procedure or employment, or a manner of conduct, such adherence to a privacy, trust, or security policy, may be the topic of multiple types of contracts. \rOne way to determine the Contract.topic is to answer the question: â€œWhat is the overall objective of this legal instrument. The Contract.topic is described with more detail by the terms of the Contract.","min":0,"max":"1","base":{"path":"Contract.topic[x]","min":0,"max":"1"},"type":[{"code":"CodeableConcept"},{"code":"Reference","targetProfile":["http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Resource"]}],"isModifier":false,"isSummary":false}]}}
