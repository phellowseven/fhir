It is best practice for the identifier to only appear on a single resource instance, however business practices may occasionally dictate that multiple resource instances with the same identifier can exist - possibly even with different resource types.  For example, multiple Patient and a Person resource instance might share the same social insurance number.","min":0,"max":"*","base":{"path":"NutritionOrder.instantiatesCanonical","min":0,"max":"*"},"type":[{"code":"canonical","targetProfile":["http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/ActivityDefinition","http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/PlanDefinition"]}],"isModifier":false,"isSummary":true,"mapping":[{"identity":"workflow","map":"Request.instantiatesCanonical"},{"identity":"v2","map":"Varies by domain"},{"identity":"rim","map":".outboundRelationship[typeCode=DEFN].target"}]}]}}
