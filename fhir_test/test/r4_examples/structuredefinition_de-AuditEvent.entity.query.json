The base64 is a general-use and safe container for event specific data blobs regardless of the encoding used by the transaction being recorded.  An AuditEvent consuming application must understand the event it is consuming and the formats used by the event. For example, if auditing an Oracle network database access, the Oracle formats must be understood as they will be simply encoded in the base64binary blob.","requirements":"For query events, it may be necessary to capture the actual query input to the query process in order to identify the specific event. Because of differences among query implementations and data encoding for them, this is a base 64 encoded data blob. It may be subsequently decoded or interpreted by downstream audit analysis processing.","min":0,"max":"1","base":{"path":"AuditEvent.entity.query","min":0,"max":"1"},"type":[{"code":"base64Binary"}],"condition":["sev-1"],"isModifier":false,"isSummary":true,"mapping":[{"identity":"w5","map":"FiveWs.context"},{"identity":"rim","map":"No mapping"},{"identity":"dicom","map":"ParticipantObjectQuery"}]}]}}
