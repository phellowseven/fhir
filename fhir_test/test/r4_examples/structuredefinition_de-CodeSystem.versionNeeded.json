But this is not always possible, so some code systems may be defined as 'versionNeeded'.\n\nMost code systems occasionally refine the displays defined for concepts between versions. Contexts in which the concept display values are validated may require that the version be specified for some code systems irrespective of the value of this property.","min":0,"max":"1","base":{"path":"CodeSystem.versionNeeded","min":0,"max":"1"},"type":[{"code":"boolean"}],"isModifier":false,"isSummary":true}]}}
