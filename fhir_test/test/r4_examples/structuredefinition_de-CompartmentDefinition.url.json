Considerations for making this decision are found in [Technical and Business Versions](resource.html#versions). \n\nIn some cases, the resource can no longer be found at the stated url, but the url itself cannot change. Implementations can use the [meta.source](resource.html#meta) element to indicate where the current master source of the resource can be found.","requirements":"Allows the compartment definition to be referenced by a single globally unique identifier.","min":1,"max":"1","base":{"path":"CompartmentDefinition.url","min":1,"max":"1"},"type":[{"code":"uri"}],"isModifier":false,"isSummary":true,"mapping":[{"identity":"workflow","map":"Definition.url"},{"identity":"w5","map":"FiveWs.identifier"}]}]}}
