However, as reported information based on the knowledge of the patient or reporting friend/relative, there may be situations where the reported sex might not be totally accurate.  E.g. 'Aunt Sue' might be XY rather than XX.  Questions soliciting this information should be phrased to encourage capture of genetic sex where known.  However, systems performing analysis should also allow for the possibility of imprecision with this element.","requirements":"Not all relationship codes imply sex and the relative's sex can be relevant for risk assessments.","min":0,"max":"1","base":{"path":"FamilyMemberHistory.sex","min":0,"max":"1"},"type":[{"code":"CodeableConcept"}],"isModifier":false,"isSummary":true,"binding":{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-bindingName","valueString":"Sex"}],"strength":"extensible","description":"Codes describing the sex assigned at birth as documented on the birth registration.","valueSet":"http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/administrative-gender"}}]}}
