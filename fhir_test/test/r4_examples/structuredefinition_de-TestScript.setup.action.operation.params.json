If \"params\" element is specified, then \"targetId\" element is ignored.  For FHIR operations that require a resource (e.g. \"read\" and \"vread\" operations), the \"resource\" element must be specified when \"params\" element is specified.  If \"url\" and \"params\" elements are absent, then the request url will be constructed from \"targetId\" fixture if present.  For \"read\" operation, the resource and id values will be extracted from \"targetId\" fixture and used to construct the url.  For \"vread\" and \"history\" operations, the versionId value will also be used.   Test engines would append whatever is specified for \"params\" to the URL after the resource type without tampering with the string (beyond encoding the URL for HTTP).  The \"params\" element does not correspond exactly to \"search parameters\".  Nor is it the \"path\".  It corresponds to the part of the URL that comes after the [type] (when \"resource\" element is specified); e.g. It corresponds to \"/[id]/_history/[vid] {?_format=[mime-type]}\" in the following operation: GET [base]/[type]/[id]/_history/[vid] {?_format=[mime-type]}  Test engines do have to look for placeholders (${}) and replace the variable placeholders with the variable values at runtime before sending the request.","min":0,"max":"1","base":{"path":"TestScript.setup.action.operation.params","min":0,"max":"1"},"type":[{"code":"string"}],"isModifier":false,"isSummary":false}]}}
