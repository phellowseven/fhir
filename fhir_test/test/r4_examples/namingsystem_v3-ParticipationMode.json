Examples:\r\nPhysically present, over the telephone, written communication.  Rationale:\r\nParticularly for author (originator) participants this is used to specify whether the information represented by the act was initially provided verbally, (hand-)written, or electronically.  Open Issue:\r\nThere needs to be a reexamination of the hierarchies as there seems to be some muddling between ELECTRONIC and other concepts that involve electronic communication that are in other hierarchies.","uniqueId":[{"type":"uri","value":"http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ParticipationMode","preferred":true},{"type":"oid","value":"2.16.840.1.113883.5.1064","preferred":false}]}
