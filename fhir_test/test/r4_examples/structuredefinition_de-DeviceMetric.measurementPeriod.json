This is not necessarily the same as the update period. The measurement repetition time can range from milliseconds up to hours. An example for a measurement repetition time in the range of milliseconds is the sampling rate of an ECG. An example for a measurement repetition time in the range of hours is a NIBP that is triggered automatically every hour. The update period may be different than the measurement repetition time, if the device does not update the published observed value with the same frequency as it was measured.","min":0,"max":"1","base":{"path":"DeviceMetric.measurementPeriod","min":0,"max":"1"},"type":[{"code":"Timing"}],"isModifier":false,"isSummary":true}]}}
