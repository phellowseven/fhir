This is most likely to be used where type values have orthogonal values, such as a religious, academic and medical center.\n\nWe expect that some jurisdictions will profile this optionality to be a single cardinality.","requirements":"Need to be able to track the kind of organization that this is - different organization types have different uses.","min":0,"max":"*","base":{"path":"Organization.type","min":0,"max":"*"},"type":[{"code":"CodeableConcept"}],"isModifier":false,"isSummary":true,"binding":{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-bindingName","valueString":"OrganizationType"}],"strength":"example","description":"Used to categorize the organization.","valueSet":"http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/organization-type"},"mapping":[{"identity":"w5","map":"FiveWs.class"},{"identity":"v2","map":"No equivalent in v2"},{"identity":"rim","map":".code"},{"identity":"servd","map":"n/a"}]}]}}
