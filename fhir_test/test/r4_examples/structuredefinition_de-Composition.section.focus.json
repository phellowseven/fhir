If not focus is specified, the focus is assumed to be focus of the parent section, or, for a section in the Composition itself, the subject of the composition. Sections with a focus SHALL only include resources where the logical subject (patient, subject, focus, etc.) matches the section focus, or the resources have no logical subject (few resources).","comment":"Typically, sections in a doument are about the subject of the document, whether that is a  patient, or group of patients, location, or device, or whatever. For some kind of documents, some sections actually contain data about related entities. Typical examples are  a section in a newborn discharge summary concerning the mother, or family history documents, with a section about each family member, though there are many other examples.","min":0,"max":"1","base":{"path":"Composition.section.focus","min":0,"max":"1"},"type":[{"code":"Reference","targetProfile":["http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Resource"]}],"isModifier":false,"isSummary":false,"mapping":[{"identity":"cda","map":".subject?
