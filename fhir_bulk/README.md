# fhir_bulk

A package for dealing with FHIR flat-files or FHIR bulk data. This was recommended to us to develop by [ONC](https://www.healthit.gov/). FHIR® is the registered trademark of HL7 and is used with the permission of HL7. Use of the FHIR trademark does not constitute endorsement of this product by HL7. 

It's pretty straight forward but I'll update the documentation at some point.
